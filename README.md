# Classifyre (PUP Capstone Project)
**Web-based Class Scheduling System with Conflict Detection and Automation (ASP.NET Core MVC, SQL Server, Tailwind CSS)**

---

## Overview
Classifyre is a web-based class scheduling system designed to minimize manual and repetitive tasks, and prevent scheduling conflicts through intelligent conflict detection using a genetic algorithm and resolution. Key automation features include exporting timetables to Excel and streamlining administrative tasks, improving overall efficiency for academic scheduling.

## Tech Stack

**Backend / Framework**  
- ASP.NET Core MVC (Model-View-Controller pattern, modular architecture, routing, model binding, validation, Web APIs, dependency injection, middleware integration)  
- C# (data models, logic implementation, database interactions, exception handling, type-safe development)  

**Frontend / UI**  
- HTML (structure of web pages)  
- Tailwind CSS / CSS (styling and layout)  
- JavaScript (interactivity and client-side functionality)  
- Figma (UI/UX design, screen prototypes, design-to-code workflow)  

**Database / Data Management**  
- Microsoft SQL Server (data storage, transactional support, query optimization, data integrity and security)  

**Security / Encryption**  
- AES-256 encryption (data security, cryptographic protection against side-channel attacks)  
- OCR for secure data capture and processing  

**Tools / Development Environment**  
- Visual Studio / VS Code (IDE for coding, debugging, Git integration, cross-platform support, plugin ecosystem)  

**Algorithms / Scheduling Optimization**  
- Genetic Algorithm (GA) (conflict detection and automated scheduling optimization)  
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)  
- Greedy Algorithm  
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)  
- Graph Coloring Algorithm  
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) methods  
- First-Come First-Served (FCFS)

## Lessons Learned
- Gained hands-on experience with backend development using the ASP.NET Core MVC architecture (C#) and implemented many-to-many relationships with database model management in SQL Server.  
- Designed responsive user interfaces using Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS, and enhanced UI/UX with Figma and JavaScript.  
- Oversaw Agile project management, structured QA testing, and produced comprehensive technical documentation.  
- Strengthened understanding of MVC architecture and separation of concerns, improving maintainability and scalability of web applications.
